## About This [Laravel 8](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/releases) Project

This is a Web Based Inventory Management System that I built for a logistic company as a project when I was an intern. 

The purpose of this Web Application is to keep track of every single item that goes in and out of the company inventory, make reports out of those items, and for this application to be used by the users and be managed by the admins in the company.

The project is built in the newest version of Laravel 8 and uses these external packages:
- [Image Intervention v3](https://image.intervention.io/v3)
- [Laravel Excel](https://docs.laravel-excel.com/3.1/getting-started/installation.html)
- [Laravel Debugbar](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-debugbar)
