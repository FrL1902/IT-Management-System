## About This [Laravel 8](https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/releases) Project

This Web Application is built on top of already made [Inventory Management System](https://github.com/FrL1902/IT-Management-System) from this repository

This is a Web Based IT Management System that I built for a logistic company as a project when I was an intern. 

The purpose of this Web Application is to keep track of ALL IT assets in the company. This Web application is only meant to be used by the IT department of the company
